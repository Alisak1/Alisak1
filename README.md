ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alisa, a UX/UI Designer and soon-to-be Full Stack Web Developer.

ðŸŽ¯ Career Goal: To become a well-rounded developer who bridges the gap between design and code, building seamless, accessible, and engaging user experiences.

ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Into:

â€¢	Human-centered design & usability
â€¢	Responsive web design & accessibility
â€¢	Full-stack applications with clean architecture
â€¢	Agile collaboration and continuous improvement

ðŸ›  What Iâ€™m Working On:
I'm currently building projects that combine design thinking with development, such as interactive web apps, redesigning existing interfaces, and learning how to implement RESTful APIs and backend services.

ðŸŒ± Always learning. Always building.
Letâ€™s connect and create something meaningful.

The following displays the sample websites I have made using HTML and CSS:

Space Station Website Project: An example page using HTML and CSS that illustrates a navbar, image containers, and form.
Movie Theater Website Project: An example page using Bootstrap 4, components include a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

Capstone Project:

Mock and prototype website design for a construction company.
